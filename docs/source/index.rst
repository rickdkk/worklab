Introduction
------------

In wheelchair propulsion the main source of energy loss is rolling friction, which depends on
the wheelchair, user, and wheelchair-user interface. At high speeds aerodynamic drag rapidly
increases as it is a non-linear function of speed (Figure 1 ). Wheelchair design, mechanics, and
maintenance can significantly alter the resistive forces acting on the wheelchair and user. In
an everyday setting these forces are to be minimised to reduce strain and, in a sports setting,
they have to be minimised to optimize performance. The forces can either be identified
through a drag-test or with the coasting deceleration method. This document will give a short
overview of rolling resistance, air drag, and how to determine them. It will also provide some
reference values where possible that can be used for simulation on a treadmill or wheelchair
ergometer. It aims to be as concise as possible.
